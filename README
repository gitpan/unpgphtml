After I had read the nice page of Noel Bell (mailto:EJNBell@pobox.com)
"PGP signed web-pages" at http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp-www.html, I thought
"nice method but not very simple to use".
For this reason I write a simple perl tool pgphtml to generate PGP signed
web-pages.

This is the relative tool to return to the originals from PGP signed web-pages

If you want to know more about this tool, you might want
to read the docs. They came together with unpgphtml!

Enjoy it!

Send me your suggestions.
